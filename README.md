# OCDS Ontology
Repository for the OCDS ontology that is being developed in the TBFY project

# Knowledge Graph
This is the repository where all the work towards the creation of the OCDS ontology will be done. This repository is related to the [TBFY Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/TBFY/knowledge-graph) activities that are being done in the context of Work Packages 1 and 2. In this repository we will keep:

* Ontology model file that defines the schema for the OCDS ontology. Currently two versions:
  * OCDS ontology that only includes core OCDS terms [ [.ttl file](https://github.com/TBFY/ocds-ontology/blob/master/model/ocds.ttl) ]
  * OCDS extended ontology that includes extensions provided by OCDS and community [ [.ttl file](https://github.com/TBFY/ocds-ontology/blob/master/model/ocds-extended.ttl) ]
* UML model with the main concepts of the OCDS extended ontology [ [.mdj file](https://github.com/TBFY/ocds-ontology/blob/master/documentation/ocds-ontology-model.mdj) ]
* [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUkFq3y1CtZGppkliAIDXXGV5Ff3TwCVgu4yeN1wUOg/edit?usp=sharing) documenting the OCDS extended ontology terms
